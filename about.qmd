My name is Will, I'm a Data Engineer at the Halifax International Airport. I write about things that interest me in the world of data engineering and data science. I'm an enthusiastic R developer, and author of the [maestro](https://github.com/whipson/maestro) package.

Most of my working hours are spent managing a data platform - building data pipelines, managing databases, and serving consumers of data. Outside of that I like reading, drawing, and watching spy films.

Writes about:

-   R

-   Data Engineering

-   Data Visualization
