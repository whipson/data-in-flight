Include only a single detailed sketch of a light bulb. The background should be a d.webp){fig-alt=\"Blueprint style image showing lightbulbs\"}\n\nIn the previous post we saw how `maestro` helps orchestrate data pipelines in a single R project. For maestro to be useful you need to deploy it somewhere and these days that 'somewhere' is often cloud-based. Here we'll walk through deploying a maestro project in the cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).[^1]\n\n[^1]: Why GCP and not AWS or Azure? We chose GCP for this initial post on deployment for two reasons. First is it has always free tiers for commonly used services. For lightweight use cases, you won't have to worry about incurring a cloud bill. Another reason is I've found the learning curve for GCP much gentler compared to AWS and Azure. In general, GCP is much better at helping you do what you need to do at very little to no cost (for lightweight jobs).\n\nThis post assumes some familiarity with the `maestro` package although the practice of deploying on GCP can be generalized to almost any project. The previous [blog post](../hello-maestro/hello-maestro.qmd) walks through maestro specifically.\n\nThis project is available on Github [here](https://github.com/whipson/maestro_gcp).\n\n## Design\n\nLike any cloud offering, GCP gives us many different ways to solve the same problem.[^2] My suggested design is by no means the only way nor is it necessarily the best way. I strove for simplicity. In the end, I landed on 3 GCP services needed to deploy the project:\n\n[^2]: Cloud providers are great at packaging the same fundamental activity in a million different ways. Try not to get overwhelmed with all the different services in GCP. Usually you'll only ever make use of a few of the most common ones. Everything comes down to compute and storage.\n\n1.  Cloud Build for hosting the containerized project.\n2.  Cloud Run Jobs for executing the container.\n3.  Cloud Scheduler for scheduling the container to run.\n\nThe most complicated of these is the first step and requires some familiarity with Docker (and ideally Github).\n\n## Dockerizing Maestro\n\nThe best way to ensure that our maestro project runs in the cloud with all its dependencies is to use Docker. Docker is widespread in software development these days and is practically a requirement for deploying anything. I won't go over the fundamentals of Docker here (Alex Gold's *DevOps for Data Science* has a [Demystifying Docker](https://do4ds.com/chapters/sec1/1-6-docker.html) chapter that is very helpful if you're new or rusty with Docker).\n\nWe need to create a `Dockerfile` at the root level of the project. I used `dockerfiler` for this. It has a function `dock_from_renv()` and it got me about 90% of the way there. As implied in the name you need to be using `renv`.[^3]\n\n[^3]: Yes, I realize this may feel like a lot before we've even made it to GCP. While Docker and renv create additional work (and often frustration) up front, it truly is more beneficial when it comes to the actual deployment. Without Docker, setting up the runtime is an especially painful game of whack-a-mole. This doesn't mean you won't have to whack a few moles first though.\n\nAfter using dockerfiler to generate the Dockerfile, I made some necessary tweaks. The main thing is to add a few system libraries and to add the `ENTRYPOINT [\"Rscript\", \"orchestrator.R\"]` so that Google Cloud Run knows to execute that script:\n\n``` dockerfile\n# Dockerfile\nFROM rocker/r-ver\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libssl-dev \\\n    libsodium-dev \\\n    zlib1g-dev \\\n    pkg-config \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nRUN R -e 'install.packages(\"remotes\")'\nRUN R -e 'remotes::install_version(\"renv\", version = \"1.0.7\")'\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY . .\nRUN R -e 'renv::restore()'\nENTRYPOINT [\"Rscript\", \"orchestrator.R\"]\n```\n\nI also had to add some system libraries (`libcurl4-openssl-dev` for making the API requests). This part is a bit tedious and will depend on your situation. For instance, if you're doing anything geospatial you may need lib-gdal. ChatGPT was pretty helpful when I ran into errors building my docker image.\n\nThis leads us to the next step: building the image and testing it in a container locally. This is where you can debug problems before you go to deploy to GCP.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ndocker build -t maestro_gcp .\ndocker run maestro_gcp --rm\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Creating a cloudbuild.yaml\n\nThe cloudbuild.yaml is a configuration file for telling GCP what image to use and how to build it. Think of it as the link connecting your project to the place where the docker image will live in GCP. Full confession: ChatGPT helped me with this one:\n\n```         \nsteps:\n- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'\n  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/maestro-gcp', '.']\nimages:\n- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/maestro-gcp'\noptions:\n  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY\n```\n\nName this file `cloudbuild.yaml` and add it to the root level of your project. At this point, you should have a project structure that looks something like this:\n\n```         \n.\n├── Dockerfile\n├── cloudbuild.yaml\n├── maestro-gcp-deploy.Rproj\n├── orchestrator.R\n├── pipelines\n├── renv\n└── renv.lock\n```\n\n## Hosting the Container on GCP\n\nThe great thing about Cloud Build is you can host a project with a Dockerfile on Github and deploy it to GCP from there.\n\nCreate the Github repo and push the project code there. Then, in the GCP console and, inside of Cloud Build \\> Triggers, select Connect Repository.\n\nOnce you open the Connect Repository wizard and select Github, it'll step you through some authentication.\n\n![Successful Cloud Build in GCP Console.](images/gcp-build-success.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of GCP Console showing successful cloud build.\"}\n\n## Create Cloud Job Run\n\nIf your build was successful, congrats! You made it through the hardest part. We now go to Cloud Run Jobs.[^4] Go to Create Job and browse through to find your recently build container.\n\n[^4]: Make sure you choose Create Job and not Create Service. Services listen for HTTP requests whereas jobs can be triggered by a cron schedule.\n\n![Create Job wizard in GCP Console.](images/gcp-cloud-run-create.png){fig-alt=\"Create Job wizard in GCP Console.\"}\n\nYou may also want to select the box to 'Execute job immediately' to test that the container runs as expected.\n\n## Schedule It\n\nWe can stay right within the Cloud Run service to do the scheduling even though it is handled by Google Cloud Scheduler.\n\nClick on your newly created job and then on Triggers \\> Add Scheduler Trigger:\n\n![Adding a scheduler trigger to the cloud job.](images/gcp-schedule-create.png){fig-alt=\"GCP Console showing Cloud Scheduler job.\"}\n\nThe Frequency input uses cron syntax. You can use [Crontab](https://crontab.guru/) to help specify the schedule. When it's created you should see something below like this:\n\n![Successfully created cron schedule for Cloud Run Job.](images/gcp-trigger-created.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of GCP Console showing successfully created scheduler job.\"}\n\nI like to trigger the job manually too to see how it runs, or you can just wait until the schedule kicks in.\n\n![Logs of the cloud run job.](images/gcp-logs.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the GCP console showing the successful run of a scheduled job.\"}\n\n## Final Remarks\n\nAnd that about sums it up for the deployment. Cloud deployment is almost never a straightforward process, so be prepared for some failed attempts. I relied on ChatGPT when I ran into problems. My organization gives us access to ChatGPT 4o and it seems to have an excellent grasp of GCP. It tends to provide command line instructions rather than point-click in the GCP console, but this is for your benefit - it's more reproducible and stable.\n",
